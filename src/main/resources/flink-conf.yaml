jobmanager.memory.process.size: 1600m

# The host interface the TaskManager will bind to. By default, this is localhost, and will prevent
# the TaskManager from communicating outside the machine/container it is running on.
# On YARN this setting will be ignored if it is set to 'localhost', defaulting to 0.0.0.0.
# On Kubernetes this setting will be ignored, defaulting to 0.0.0.0.
#
# To enable this, set the bind-host address to one that has access to an outside facing network
# interface, such as 0.0.0.0.

taskmanager.bind-host: localhost

# The address of the host on which the TaskManager runs and can be reached by the JobManager and
# other TaskManagers. If not specified, the TaskManager will try different strategies to identify
# the address.
#
# Note this address needs to be reachable by the JobManager and forward traffic to one of
# the interfaces the TaskManager is bound to (see 'taskmanager.bind-host').
#
# Note also that unless all TaskManagers are running on the same machine, this address needs to be
# configured separately for each TaskManager.

taskmanager.host: localhost

# The total process memory size for the TaskManager.
#
# Note this accounts for all memory usage within the TaskManager process, including JVM metaspace and other overhead.

taskmanager.memory.process.size: 1728m

# To exclude JVM metaspace and overhead, please, use total Flink memory size instead of 'taskmanager.memory.process.size'.
# It is not recommended to set both 'taskmanager.memory.process.size' and Flink memory.
#
# taskmanager.memory.flink.size: 1280m

# The number of task slots that each TaskManager offers. Each slot runs one parallel pipeline.

taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots: 1

# The parallelism used for programs that did not specify and other parallelism.
