19465288    comment derefr  2019-03-22 18:15:21 "Because we&#x27;re talking about the backend-deployment+ops-jargon terms &quot;website&quot; and &quot;webapp&quot;, not their general usage. Words can have precise jargon meanings <i>which are different</i> in different disciplines. This is where ops people tend to draw the line: a web<i>site</i> is something you can deploy to e.g. an S3 bucket and it&#x27;ll be fully functional, with no other dependencies that you have to maintain for it. A <i>webapp</i> is something that <i>does</i> have such dependencies that you need to set up and maintain—e.g. a database layer.<p>But even ignoring that, I also define the terms this way because of the prefix &quot;web.&quot; A webapp isn&#x27;t &quot;an app on the web&quot;, but rather &quot;an app powered by the web.&quot; An entirely-offline JavaScript SPA that is just <i>served over</i> the web, <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a web-app. It&#x27;s just a program that runs in a browser, just like a Flash or ActiveX or Java applet is a program that runs in a browser. (Is a Flash game a &quot;web game&quot;? It&#x27;s usually considered a <i>browser game</i>, but that&#x27;s not the same thing.)<p>We already have a term for the thing that {Flash, ActiveX, Java} applets are: apps. Offline JavaScript SPAs are just apps too. We don&#x27;t need to add the prefix &quot;web&quot;; it&#x27;s meaningless here. In any of those cases, if you took the exact same program, and slammed it into an Electron wrapper instead of into a domain-fronted S3 bucket, it would clearly not be a &quot;web app&quot; in any sense. Your SPA would just be &quot;a JavaScript <i>app</i> that uses a browser DOM as its graphics toolkit.&quot; Well, that&#x27;s just as true before you put it in the Electron wrapper.<p>So &quot;web app&quot;, then, has a specific meaning, above and beyond &quot;app.&quot; You need something extra. That something extra is a backend, which your browser—driven by the app&#x27;s logic—interacts with <i>over the web</i>. That&#x27;s what makes an app &quot;a web app.&quot; (This definition intentionally encompasses both server-rendered dynamic HTML, and client-rendered JavaScript SPA apps. You don&#x27;t need a frontend <i>app</i>; you just need a <i>web backend</i> that something is interacting with. That something can be the browser directly, by clicking links and submitting forms; or it can be a JavaScript frontend, using AJAX.)<p>A &quot;web site&quot;, then, is a &quot;web app&quot; without the &quot;app&quot; part. If it&#x27;s clear in the above definition what an &quot;app&quot; is, and what a &quot;web app&quot; is, then you can subtract one from the other to derive a definition of a &quot;web not-app.&quot; That&#x27;s a website: something powered by a web backend, which does not do any app things. If we decide that &quot;app things&quot; are basically &quot;storing state&quot;, then a &quot;site&quot; is an &quot;app&quot; with no persistent state.<p>And since the definition of &quot;web&quot; here is about a backend, then the difference between a &quot;web app&quot; and a &quot;web site&quot; (a web not-app) is probably defined by the properties of the backend. So the difference about the ability of the web backend to store state. So a &quot;web site&quot; is a &quot;web app&quot; where the backend does no app things—i.e., stores no state."   []

The permit to built the studio makes that building legit, kinda forever. A motor home, they can chase out with a new law, or just by enforcing existing laws."  []

I&#x27;m perfectly fine with depriving car owners from this convenience to allow a human being to have a roof over their head. (speaking from direct experience as I&#x27;ve just minutes ago had to park my car 1km away from home because the city is currently building housing and has restricted parking space nearby)<p>Then, some might argue that one should be ashamed of helping animals while humans are suffering. That&#x27;s the exact same train of thought with «we can&#x27;t allow more migrants in, we have to take care of our &quot;own&quot; homeless people».<p>This is a false dichotomy. Western societies inequalities are growing larger and larger. Me trying to do my part is insignificant. Me donating to human or animal causes is a small dent into the mountains of inequalities we live on top of. Us collectively, we do make a difference, by donating, voting and generally keeping our eyes open about the world we live in...<p>Finally, an entirely anecdotal pov: I&#x27;ve witnessed several times extremely poor people going out of their ways to show solidarity to animals or humans. I&#x27;ve also witnessed an awful lot of extremely wealthy individuals complaining about the poor inconveniencing them by just being there, whose wealth was a direct consequences of their ancestors exploiting whose very same poor people."
